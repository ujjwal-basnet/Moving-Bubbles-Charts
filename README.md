# Below you will see time is moving and as time moves some dot's are
also moving from one cluster to another cluster .....

basically ... i create 5 states(cluster) for a person(sample_id) and each dot symbolizes a person going about their day .

They are performing their states like ['Eating', 'Sleeping', 'Home', 'Working', 'Traveling'] At different time so as time move's
a dot(person) also move form one cluster to anotehr
(i.e at 5 am they are eating(at one cluster) ..... time passed ... not its 9 .... now
dot is moving to another cluster (i.r home to working ) or any other



also note ( i added probabilities to each state manually , so you'll see some activities happening more often than others




## Made using 
 D3Blocks is a library that contains various charts for which the visualization part is built on (d3) javascript but configurable using Python
